The problem for a beginner is how to 'boot-strap' yourself out of ignorance when that ignorance makes it hard to choose the right course.

Choosing resources when studying to be a web developer is a mine field. There are a lot of how-to's, and probably also many how-not-to's. I want to learn the 'best way' from the start but with the web there is always the challenge of sorting the wheat from the chaff.

There are tools like up-voting if the community rates a resource but majority rules doesn't necessary get the best results. The other flakey way of judging the value of something when you are a beginner is gut instinct which is entirely unscientific. So having said that, here is a list of resources I have chosen to use (and by no means does that mean they are useful).

[Computer Science 101 Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/course/cs101)
This one is simple, fun and cleverly uses metaphor to explain some complicated ideas. A great place to start (again).

[How to design Programs](htdp.org)
Two good ideas here. Make the language environment simple at the start and build  it's features inline with the course. Secondly use functional programming from the outset (or am I just a fashion victim?)

 Also check out this unusual book called [The Little Schemer](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer) which helps understanding of recursion and all that - good for baking your noodle.

[Douglas Crockford on JavaScript - 8 lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7664379246A246CB)
Douglas Crockford created JSON, JSLint, JSCheck and much more. He is a entertaining speaker if a little cranky and his philosophy for programming is valuable in my opinion. I recommend his first lecture for it's historical value and the 8th for the pschological perspective but there are nuggets strew through-out. Sometimes it gets a bit heavy for someone who doesn't know javascript, I just tuned out till the technical part was over. I'll be revisiting these videos often when I learn javascript.

[Ashley Williams: If you wish to learn ES6/2015 from scratch, you must first invent the universe](https://youtu.be/DN4yLZB1vUQ)
Cooky but interesting talk that references way to many philosphers. I'm not sure what she is trying to say but Racket got a mention. yay!
