I'm 38 years old, I have two boys and I need to change career. The prospect of doing what I was doing for another 30 years was making me depressed. I need a lot of mental simulation or I go nuts. I want to spend my time around smart hardworking people who enjoy what they are doing for a living and also be a smart hardworking person who enjoys what he does for a living.

With a family to support I can’t afford to be unsalaried and certainly can't afford to get a degree.
Information Technology changes so fast that there are more opportunities for a career-changer than traditional professions and employers are more open minded about who they hire.

I had already started a series of online courses based on [this Infoworld article](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2614635/application-development/-200k-for-a-computer-science-degree--or-these-free-online-classes-.html) which suggests you can replicate a First Class Computer Science degree using free resources on the web. Perhaps so, but I have definitely landed on my feet getting into Mayden Academy. I can't put a value on the knowledge and experience I've already gained after just one week (and there's plenty still to come).

It is also very rewarding studying in a group of intelligent and motivated people and the pace has been fast but not uncomfortable. Luke and Mike have done a great job keeping it fresh and interesting. I think it takes a very focused and determined person to go it alone. My advice is, at the very least, find a mentor to keep you from getting side tracked and wasting your time.

What do I like about Mayden so far? The focus on working efficiently. I can't abide wasting time, short term thinking or being busy just for the sake of it. Being a parent teaches you that time is precious. However while people are getting on with the job there is still time for plenty of ‘good craic’. The atmosphere is extremely pleasant and I'm really looking forward to week two.
