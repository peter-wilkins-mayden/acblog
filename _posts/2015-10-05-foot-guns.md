Brendan Icke, who created javascript in 10 days, coined the phrase 'Foot Guns' to describe practises in programming that are unnecessary and risky. Douglas Crockford, author of JSLint, calls it 'Danger Driven Development'. He suggests that just because a language lets you do something stupid doesn't mean you should.

I'm very happy to have discovered Linters, an invaluable tool for the beginner as they give you warning messages if you are doing something that is generally accepted to be stupid. Brings back fond memories of Microsoft's abusive paperclip, but much more useful. Here's a rude message I got today from CSSLint about my current project:
