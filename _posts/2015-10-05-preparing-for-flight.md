	How much time do we spend looking despairingly
	at our computer screens thinking "My god! What
	have I done!".
	Douglas Crockford, Javascript guru.

#One pointed mind
Paragliding preflight checks are very easy to remember to do. The prospect of death has a way of focusing the mind. I would like to achieve a similar state of mind when programming however coding with a sword hanging by a thread over your head is probably counter productive and definitely contravenes UK health and Safety directives.

#Out of control
During our first sprint there were moments of despair, hopelessness and even terror. I'd like to share with you with another moment in my life where i felt simliarly out of control and abandoned by hope. This is a video of my first landing after I got my paragliding license. Without an instructor guiding me I make a pretty terrible job of it but I do manage to avoid the water. Be warned there is some bad language from the camera woman. enjoy:

##lazy man's zen
Riding a motorcycle is called lazy man's zen because the risk automatically makes you pay more attention. How we bring this focus to coding without water and electrodes I don't know. Perhaps it is simply a matter of will power but as with all pursuits where error has serious consequences, after a while the survivors normally develop a routine of good habits that see them through. So come on you battle scarred veterans of computer carnage, share your secrets with us below....
