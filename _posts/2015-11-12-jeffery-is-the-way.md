The best resource I have used in the Academy so far is the videos on [Laracast](http://laracasts.com), specifically the Kata series.

Kata's are a brilliant way to practise and learn to code because you are not only solving a simple problem with a clear goal but you are also improving your work flow, learning tricks and shortcuts in your IDE and you can compare your solution with others.

Even more so, if you practise along with a master then you are really going to go places. Jeffery Way of Laracast is a very fast coder.If you watch his videos straight through you will come away bemused. Don't do this if you are a beginner. Download the video and use your media buttons or global hot-keys to pause the video whenever you are not 100% up with what he is doing. Work along with him - he often puts his code on github - coding, figure out his short cuts and macros ( he has videos on these too). Generally try to mimic him as much as possible.

At first it is a very slow process and a 20 minute video will take 3 hours to digest. He builds on themes in early videos and speeds up through the series. Make sure to work through the Kata series in order as The idea of Katas is to practise them repeatedly so do it over and over with Jeffery till you feel confident to go it alone. After a few iterations it will only take an hour! The pay off comes when you start a project, the speed and confidence in your work will surprise you and makes coding incredibly fun nd rewarding

The other huge bonus is that doing Katas will get you into unit testing. I honestly can't imagine coding anything slightly complicated without tests ever again. Sometimes if I don't know what to test them I will code around till I get inspired - I feel pretty naughty doing this - and I write tests as soon as I know what to test. Without them I would go insane. With them I am often pleasantly surprised that my code works. That confidence is priceless and definitly worth the time they take to write in the long run.

The last video in the series is also useful demonstrating the power of OOP and the process of refactoring legacy code. He takes a mess of spagetti code and turns it into a very simple (in the good way) code. Doing other Katas on [Cyber Dojo](http://cyber-dojo.org) is also an excellent starting place.
